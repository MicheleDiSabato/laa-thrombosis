# Ranking Left Atrial Appendages (LAAs) by risk of thrombosis

## Theoretical background
[Thrombosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis) occurs when blood becomes stagnant and forms clots which end up clogging its flow, causing clinical complications such as stroke, heart attack, and serious breathing problems. One region particularly affected by this risk is the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA):

Because of its position, it is a region prone to blood clots formation caused by the low velocity flow of blood [^1].

In the literature, experts have found recurrent features which appear in many geoemtries. Thus, LAA geometries are divided into 4 categories:
* chicken wing (CW)
* windsock (WS)
* cactus (CS)
* cauliflower (CF)

## Shape models
To produce the meshes, we relied on [GMSH](https://gmsh.info/).

To model the four geometries we used shape models based on [radial basis functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function):
1.   control points on the initial template mesh are manually selected and saved in a csv file;
2.   control points on the final mesh are selected and saved  in a csv file;
3.   using these csv files, the displacements of the control points are computed;
4.   parameter 系 of the RBF is tuned for each shape model;
5.   RBF are applied to obtain the final geometries.

These are the RBF used for the 4 models:
*   CS: multiquadratic, 系 = 5
*   CW: no need for RBF, since this gemoetry is very simple
*   WS: gaussian, 系 = 50
*   CF: inverse quadratic, 系 = 6

As you can imagine, on a scale from going to the bathroom and forgetting your phone to watching Amber Heard's testimony on repeat, this procedure is one of the most annoyingly boring and irrititating things on that list, since we'd need to *manually* position more than 120 points. To avoid doing so, we automated every possible step:

For each geometry:
1. Define the position of a suitable number of control points, i.e. we write a .geo file and compile it, to get a .msh file, called $\verb|original_template_*.geo|$ and $\verb|original_template_*.msh|$. For example, the cauliflower should have more control points on the right side, since it is characterized by more spikes in that region with respect to the other geometries.

1. Write another .geo file (called $\verb|modified_template_*.geo|$), positioning the control points to match the final shape.

1. Run a python file, which reads the two .geo and the .msh file, extracts the relevant information, such as the location of the control points, and computes the shifts.

1. The same python file then computes the weights of the shape model and applies the radial basis function to all the points contained in $\verb|original_template_*.msh|$.

1. The same python file writes an entire .geo file (called $\verb|[GEOMETRY_NAME].geo|$), containing the coordinates of the points in the $\verb|original_template_*.msh|$ file, shifted according to the radial basis function.

1. Finally, we use GMSH to compile the $\verb|[GEOMETRY_NAME].geo|$ file just created and obtain the corresponding $\verb|[GEOMETRY_NAME].msh|$ file, which will be uploaded into the FreeFemm++ code.

The script we wrote can be used to generate an entire dataset of shape models/geometries, just by adding minor modifications to the basis functions.

**Issue:** beware that the final msh file should produce a non-overlapping mesh, otherwise the [FreeFem code](solver.edp) won't work.
