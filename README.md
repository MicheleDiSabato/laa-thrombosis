# Ranking Left Atrial Appendages (LAAs) by risk of thrombosis

## Theoretical background
[Thrombosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombosis) occurs when blood becomes stagnant and forms clots which end up clogging its flow, causing clinical complications such as stroke, heart attack, and serious breathing problems. One region particularly affected by this risk is the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA):

Because of its position, it is a region prone to blood clots formation caused by the low velocity flow of blood [^1].

In the literature, experts have found recurrent features which appear in many geoemtries. Thus, LAA geometries are divided into 4 categories:
* chicken wing (CW)
* windsock (WS)
* cactus (CS)
* cauliflower (CF)
